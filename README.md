Project Title:
Quality traceability of farm produce using blockchain

Project Description:
Trust of quality of produce from each farm is not transparent. Currently quality is only visible at the end of the supply chain and not traceable to its source. By ensuring that quality is captured in a blockchain contract at every touchpoint, we can trace quality back to its source and have visibility of the true owner of quality depreciation and therefore can create a marketplace to rank farms by their consistent quality.
